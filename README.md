# OTC Prometheus Exporter

This software gathers metrics from the [Open Telekom Cloud (OTC)](https://open-telekom-cloud.com/)
for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). The metrics are then usable in any service which can use Prometheus as a
datasource. For example [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)

## Available Metrics

Metrics for the following services are available

- Elastic Cloud Server (ECS)
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- NAT Gateway (NAT)
- Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- Distributed Message Service (DMS)

## Requirements

- OTC-Credentials

## Usage & Configuration

In this section you will learn how to use and configure this software.
The configuration happens via environment variables and one configuration file.

1. Obtain the necessary credentials for the OTC. You need a username, password, project id and domain name.

2. Set the desired namespaces as a list of comma seperated values in the environment variable `NAMESPACES`.

3. The other environment variables are not required. The following table covers all environment variables.

| environment variable        | default value | allowed values                   | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Binary

If you want to run the application directly as a binary then you can do it by following these steps.

1. Download and decompress the binary from the release page
2. `chmod +x otc-prometheus-exporter` to make it executable.
3. On macOS, it might be necessary to remove the Apple quarantine property from it too.
   This can be done with: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine otc-prometheues-exporter`
4. `cp .env.template .env`
5. Fill out the values in the `.env` file
6. Run the programm: `env $(cat .env) ./otc-prometheues-exporter`

### Docker

If you want a single docker container with the application running then you can do it by following these steps.

1. Make sure you have docker installed and running
2. Copy the `.env.template` to `.env` and fill it out. This makes the docker command much shorter this way and your
   secrets are not listed in your shell history.
3. Run the following:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/iits-consulting/otc-prometheus-exporter:latest
docker run --env-file .env ghcr.io/iits-consulting/otc-prometheus-exporter:latest
```

### Docker Compose

If you want to start the application, a Prometheus and Grafana server all at once then you can do it by following these steps.
This is suitable for a quick test or local development because the entire tool chain is running.

1. Make sure you have docker and docker-compose installed and running
2. Copy the `.env.template` to `.env` and fill it out. This makes the docker command much shorter this way and your
   secrets are not listed in your shell history.
3. Run the following: `docker compose --env-file .env up`

### Kubernetes (Helm)

```shell
helm repo add otc-prometheus-exporter https://iits-consulting.github.io/otc-prometheus-exporter/
helm search repo otc-prometheus-exporter
helm install otc-prometheus-exporter otc-prometheus-exporter/otc-prometheus-exporter --set your_values.yaml
```
